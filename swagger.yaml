  version: "4.4.0"
  description: >
    The XML-JSON Gateway API is a comprehensive service designed to facilitate data exchange 
    and conversion between XML and JSON formats. It provides endpoints to extract data from XML 
    using XPath, validate, transform, and format XML files, as well as convert XML to JSON and JSON to XML, 
    and verify/correct JSON files. All file paths are automatically mapped to internal storage.
    An API key is required in the request header ("x-api-key") for authorization.
